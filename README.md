BayNode
=======

The South Bay area's very own Node.js usergroup/meetup.
Official site can be found at [baynode.github.io](http://baynode.github.io/)

### We use github to submit talks, lightning and otherwise

See [the lightning talk](lightning-talk-template.md) and [longform talk](talk-template.md)
templates for more details. 

See [the request for talks](request-for-talk.md) to submit what you'd love to experience at
our meetup.

#### for organizers:

For each meetup, make a new directory with an `index.md` at least a month or two in advance --
name the directory in the style, `2013-jan`. Once the talks for the meetup are finalized, put
the lineup in `index.md` with relative links to the talks.
