To submit a talk, [submit an issue](http://github.com/baynode/baynode/issues) with the following details (using this file as a template):

# The title of the lightning talk

A short description of the talk. Is it about a module? Include a relevant link to the module. If it's a short demo; link
to the relevant code on github or bitbucket.

Your aim is to get your audience interested in the topic, while being brief. Shoot for 1-3 sentences
that describe what the value of your talk will be. 

Lightning talks should be < 20 minutes long, and slides are optional but encouraged.

## Speaker <Your Name>

Include a link to your [github profile](https://github.com/baynode/), and it'd be cool if you 
embedded your avatar. What do you do for a living? How do you use Node? Include your twitter handle, if
applicable.

## Remove this section after editing

Your lightning talk will only be considered for the next meetup if it's submitted at least three days in advance, to allow for discussion
and deliberation.
