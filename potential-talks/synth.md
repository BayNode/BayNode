# Synth - The First NodeJS Back-End Framework For AngularJS Apps

Synth is a new back-end framework designed to make it as easy as possible to power front-end heavy apps powered by frameworks like AngularJS and EmberJS.

- Easily create API endpoints by just declaring functions, and return promises that eventually turn into JSON responses.
- Auto-preloads data and templates so the browser doesn't need to make multiple round-trips before displaying your app to the user.
- Use Angular-style services on the back-end. The easiest way to write DRY back-end code.
- Produce a very powerful back-end with minimal code.
