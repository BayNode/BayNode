Hi, I'm [Randall](https://github.com/rdegges)! I'm a Python / node / Golang
hacker currently working as a Developer Evangelist at
[Stormpath](https://stormpath.com/).

I've used node a lot to build various internal API services at my previous
company, [OpenCNAM](https://www.opencnam.com/), as well as to build proper node
modules and API libraries.  At OpenCNAM I built an API service which powers
billions of requests per day.
