Hi, I'm [Les](https://github.com/lhazlewood)! I'm a Java / node hacker, and CTO /
co-founder of [Stormpath](https://stormpath.com/). I also created
[Apache Shiro](http://shiro.apache.org/), one of the largest security frameworks
in the Java world.

So far, I've built the official [Stormpath Node SDK](https://github.com/stormpath/stormpath-sdk-node),
and I'm looking forward to moving more and more of our internal Java services
over to Node. &lt;3
