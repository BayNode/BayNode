To submit a talk, [submit an issue](http://github.com/baynode/baynode/issues) with the following details (using this file as a template):


# The title of the talk

A 2-5 sentence description of the talk. If you've got a long demo of a bunch of modules, or higher level topic,
it should be a long-form talk. Be prepared to accept questions at the end of the talk!

Your aim is to get the audience interested in the topic, and to include any relevant material that'll
pique their interest. 

Long-form talks should be 30+ minutes long and you should plan to have slides.

## Speaker <Your Name>

Include a link to your [github profile](https://github.com/baynode/), and it'd be cool if you 
embedded your avatar. What do you do for a living? How do you use Node? Include your twitter handle, if
applicable.

Why is this talk relevant to what you do? How did you come across this topic?

## Remove this section after editing

### Submitters

Your talk will only be considered for the next meetup if it's submitted at least one week in advance, to allow for discussion
and deliberation.
